RESPONSE:

- go to www.amazon.ca - search for "sandals" in the webpage's search bar - click on the top search result What do you think? Is this even possible? I think it is quite obvious that it would take much longer for an AI to find products online, because an AI needs to use many different sources of information, like in Wikipedia, reviews, etc... (to buy me something from amazon) What are your thoughts on this? Could you write something like this? How could I test this program? Where should I start? (where to get data, algorithms, frameworks...) Thank you very much for any suggestion or advice! :-) Answer: I don't know
