RESPONSE:

- go to amazon.ca website - find the search bar - type "sandals" into it and click enter - find "buy now" button on product page and click it - search in text bar for user's credit card number, expiry date and cvv2 code, enter them, then click continue to proceed with payment (someone asked for clarification: In order to buy from amazon, one must first sign up with amazon, i.e. create an account. Once signed up, a user can then log in with credentials (email and password). The steps required for buying from amazon include finding "sign in" button, signing in with email and password, then finding "buy now" button, clicking it and searching for the product) What I need is an example of this in code for javascript, I don't need any UI (although an example would be nice). It's just about getting some pointers on how to start
