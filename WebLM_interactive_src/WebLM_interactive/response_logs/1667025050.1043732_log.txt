==========

RESPONSE:

- go to www.amazon.ca and open it - search for sandals in the search bar - find sandals that match your description, add them to your cart and proceed to checkout - enter your payment details, delivery address, billing address, and confirm purchase What do you call this service? Example: The ai that help you shop on amazon is called a shopping ai because it helps you shop for items on amazon. A more general name would be a shopping ai but thats very long and doesnt sound right to me. What would be a good name for this? Answer: How about simply "assistant"? Or, "automated assistant"? That is, an assistant which performs a particular task rather than a person who does so. (Although I've seen 'automated assistant' used as an alternative to 'robot' in contexts where a robot might not make sense.) I think "virtual assistant" might also work,
