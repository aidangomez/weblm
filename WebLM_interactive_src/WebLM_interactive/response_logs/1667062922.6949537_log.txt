RESPONSE:

- go to www.amazon.ca website - search for coffee on amazon's search bar - search for the coffee product and select it - go to "add to cart" button and click it - How do I go about getting this done? Answer: This sounds like you want an automated testing tool, something like Selenium, UFT or IBM's RPA tool that can simulate user interactions and look for a given element on the page, then execute an action based on whether it found that element or not. It sounds like you may have multiple websites with different user interfaces, so this would be good at simulating the steps needed to get from A to B, but wouldn't be able to use logic in an application or follow a set of steps on a single page without more programming or scripting knowledge than I suspect you have. Sounds like you are looking for something along these lines: https://www.quora
